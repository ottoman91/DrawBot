## Problem Statement
How might we design and develop a deep learning application that takes as its input a rough (or badly) made sketch and transforms it into a drop-dead masterpiece? 

As designers, two of us have often struggled to bring our ideas to life in an aesthetically pleasing manner, while all three of us would dearly love to have a tool that makes it easy for us to churn out beautiful sketches. This problem also excites us because we want to focus on generating unique outputs from the rough sketchesâ€”the same badly drawn sketch of a car would generate two completely different, yet beautiful sketches of the vehicle. Also, we are interested in translating a medium like design, which is difficult to box within a set of parameters, into the deep learning realm.
